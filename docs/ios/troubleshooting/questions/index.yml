  - name: General Questions
    questions:
      - question: |
          Can I use a Mac VM with Xamarin?
        answer: |
          Yes, but only on [Mac hardware](mac-vm.md).

      - question: |
          How can I downgrade Xcode?
        answer: |
          This guide provides links to access [previous versions of Xcode](./previous-xcode.md) as well as the latest version.

      - question: |
          Where can I set my iOS SDK Locations?
        answer: |
          For most users these are set to the proper locations automatically. This guide lists the default [SDK locations](ios-sdk.md) and how to change them if needed.

      - question: |
          How can I reenable developer options after updating iOS?
        answer: |
          An iOS bug may cause the [developer options](update-developer-options.md) to disappear after updating iOS versions, this has been observed when switching to iOS 8.x. This guide describes how the options can be reenabled.

      - question: |
          User Location not working in iOS 8
        answer: |
          This guide tells you how to edit info.plist to enable [User Location](ios8-user-location.md) in iOS 8.

      - question: |
          Where can I find the .dSYM file to symbolicate iOS crash logs?
        answer: |
          This guide describes basic steps for [symbolicating iOS crash logs](symbolicate-ios-crash.md) to help with diagnosing crashes. It also links to additional resources for more advanced symbolication techniques & info on interpreting iOS crash logs.

      - question: |
          How do I set Mono Runtime environment variables for iOS projects in Xamarin Studio?
        answer: |
          If you need to set any [runtime environment](xs-mono-runtime.md) variables for Mono, they can be set in the **Project Options > Run > General** page.

  - name: Publishing Questions
    questions:
      - question: |
          Error when submitting to App Store: “Invalid Bundle - Options not allowed to be embedded in bitcode are detected in the submission”
        answer: |
          [Submitting apps that _require_ bitcode, such as watchOS and tvOS apps,
          must be done with Xcode 9](invalid-bundle-bitcode.md).

      - question: |
          Can I change the output path of the IPA file?
        answer: |
          As of Xamarin Cycle 7, you can use [customized MSBuild targets](ipa-output-path.md) to achieve this.

      - question: |
          How can I copy IPA output files to the TFS drop folder?
        answer: |
          [Yes, this guide describes how.](ipa-tfs.md)

      - question: |
          Can I add files to or remove files from an IPA file after building it in Visual Studio?
        answer: |
          Yes, it is possible but it will usually require that you re-sign the `.app` bundle after making the change. Note that [modifying](modify-ipa.md) the `.ipa` file is not necessary in normal use. This article is provided purely for informational purposes.

      - question: |
          Is it possible to create a .xcarchive archive from Visual Studio?
        answer: |
          As of Xamarin 4, it is now possible to [create a `.xcarchive`](create-xcarchive.md) from Windows by setting the `ArchiveOnBuild` property to `true`.

      - question: |
          Why does my app submission fail with: "Disallowed paths ( "iTunesMetadata.plist" ) found at ..." ?
        answer: |
          This error is the result of a change in Apple's App Store verification process. This specific error is _not_ related to the particular version of Xamarin you have installed, so downgrading will _not_ help. This guide [links](itunesmetadata-disallowed-paths.md) to more information on how to fix the issue.

  - name: Diagnosing Specific Error Messages
    questions:
      - question: |
          iOS Designer Error with RegisterServicePort
        answer: |
          Errors with [`RegisterServicePort`](error-registerserviceport.md) and similar error messages like above are commonly an issue with spyware/malware on the computer. This guide details confirming the diagnosis and info on removing the spyware/malware.

      - question: |
          Why does my iOS build fail with: no valid iPhone code signing keys found in keychain?
        answer: |
          This error message occurs when the project in question is looking for [valid code-signing credentials](no-codesigning-keys.md) but are unable to find them. Code signing is required for testing and deployments on physical iOS devices; as well as Ad-hoc & App store builds.

      - question: |
          Why does my iOS 9 app fail with: System.Exception: Failed to marshal the Objective-C object?
        answer: |
          API changes in iOS 9 require that a callback constructor be used when calling unmanaged code, as the [underlying API](exception-marshal-obj-c.md) now expects it.

      - question: |
          Runtime error: The assembly mscorlib.dll was not found or could not be loaded
        answer: |
          This issue occurs when the *hidden* `.monotouch-32` and `.monotouch-64` folders are missing from the `.xcarchive` for signing / IPA creation, triggering the [runtime error](error-mscorlib-not-found.md).

      - question: |
          Compile error: Can not encode offset X in resulting scattered relocation
        answer: |
          [This issue occurs when building for 32-bit architectures, such as ARMv7, when the final binary is too large for the native toolchain.](error-encode-offset-scattered-relocation.md)

          > [!IMPORTANT]
          > The articles below apply to issues that have been resolved in recent versions of Xamarin. However, if the issue occurs on the latest version of the software, please file a [new bug](~/cross-platform/troubleshooting/questions/howto-file-bug.md) with your full versioning information and full build log output.

  - name: Deprecated
    questions:
      - question: |
          IPA file is 0 bytes
        answer: |
          There were some known issues in previous versions of Xamarin that could cause the [IPA file on Windows to be 0 bytes](ipa-zero-bytes.md).

      - question: |
          IBTool Error: The operation couldn’t be completed.
        answer: |
          Apple fixed this [`ibtool`](error-ibtool.md) bug in Xcode 6.1.1, so upgrading to Xcode 6.1.1 or higher is the easiest fix.

      - question: |
          Error MT1009: Could not copy the assembly
        answer: |
          This affects users running Xamarin.iOS 7.2.6. This issue is due to file [permissions needing higher privileges](error-mt1009.md) when Xamarin.iOS is installed with a different user account then the developer's main account.

      - question: |
          System.Exception AMDeviceNotificationSubscribe returned ...
        answer: |
          This message can appear in an error dialog when you first start Visual Studio for Mac, or in the `mtbserver.log` file. Note that this is an uncommon problem. If Visual Studio is having [trouble connecting to the Mac build host](exception-amddevicenotificationsubscribe.md), there are other errors that are more likely to appear in the `mtbserver.log` file.

      - question: |
          MDocArchiveToMsxDocConverter.exe not found rver.BaseCommand.OnRequest
        answer: |
          [This error](mdocarchivetomsxdocconverter-not-found.md) may appear in the `Mac Server Log` in Visual Studio.
