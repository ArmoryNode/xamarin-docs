    questions:
      - question: |
          How do I migrate my app to Xamarin.Forms 5.0?
        answer: |
          Migrating an app to [Xamarin.Forms 5.0](forms5-migration.md) requires knowledge of its breaking changes.
          
      - question: |
          Can I update the Xamarin.Forms default template to a newer NuGet package?
        answer: |
          This guide uses the Xamarin.Forms .NET Standard library template as an example, but the same general method will also work for the [Xamarin.Forms Shared Project template](update-forms-template.md).
          
      - question: |
          Why doesn't the Visual Studio XAML designer work for Xamarin.Forms XAML files?
        answer: |
          [Xamarin.Forms doesn't currently support visual designers for XAML files.](forms-xaml-designer.md)
          
      - question: |
          Android build error: The "LinkAssemblies" task failed unexpectedly
        answer: |
          You may see an [error](android-linkassemblies-error.md) message `The "LinkAssemblies" task failed unexpectedly` when building a Xamarin.Android project that uses Forms. This happens when the linker is active (typically on a *Release* build to reduce the size of the app package); and it occurs because the Android targets aren't updated to the latest framework.
          
      - question: |
          "Why does my Xamarin.Forms.Maps Android project fail with COMPILETODALVIK : UNEXPECTED TOP-LEVEL ERROR?"
        answer: |
          This error may be seen in the [Error](maps-compiletodalvik-error.md) pad of Visual Studio for Mac or in the Build Output window of Visual Studio; in Android projects using Xamarin.Forms.Maps. It is most commonly resolved by increasing the Java Heap Size for your Xamarin.Android project.
